This page contains some basic setup information and links to some helpful resources.\n\n\nThe BCS documentation is basically setup to correspond to the screens available in the BCS web interface. Those screens are:\n\n\n\n\nMain Control\n\n\nData Log\n\n\nProcess Editor\n\n\nTemp Adjust\n\n\nLadder Logic\n\n\nSettings\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, there are pages to help you better understand the \nUser Interface\n, the \nBCS Finder\n application, and the  \nOnline Utilities\n.\n\n\nSetup\n\n\nThe BCS should be connected via Ethernet cable to your network.  It is configured by default to obtain an IP address via \nDHCP\n from your router.  The \nBCS Finder\n will help locate the BCS on your network. Depending on your router, you may also be able to locate the IP address given to your BCS in your router interface. It may be helpful the know the MAC address of your BCS which is printed on the BCS case.\n\n\nIt is highly recommended to create a DHCP reservation on your router so the BCS will always have the same IP address.  This setup is specific to each individual router, please check the manual for your router to learn how to set up a DHCP reservation. If the BCS is unable to lease a DHCP address, it will default to the 169.254.0.63 IP address. \n\n\nAnother option is to assign your BCS an IP address that is outside of your router's DHCP address pool. For more information on configuring a static IP address on your BCS, see \nSettings\n.\n\n\nAccessing the BCS\n\n\nThe BCS has no physical display and is normally accessed through the web interface. Once you discover the IP address of your BCS, you can just enter the BCS IP address in your favorite web browser to access the \nBCS Interface\n.\n\n\nAccessing the BCS Remotely\n\n\nEntering the local IP address of the BCS in your browser only works for accessing the BCS interface when you are on the same local area network as the BCS. If you want to access the BCS from a remote location, some additional configuration is required. \n\n\nPort Forwarding\n\n\nOne option for accessing the BCS is to use port forwarding. See your router documentation on how to configure port forwarding. Basically, port forwarding allows you to access your BCS using your public IP address on the WAN port of your router. This IP address is assigned by your ISP and is subject to change periodically. The router will translate the request coming in from the Internet to a host on the inside of your network, your BCS in this case. You can locate your public IP address by looking at your router configuration or by using an web site such as \nWhat is My IP Address\n. \n\n\nFor more information on setting your BCS IP address and port number, please see \nSettings\n.\n\n\nDynamic DNS\n\n\nSince your public IP address is usually not static, this can cause frustration when trying to access your BCS remotely. A possible solution to this problem is to use a dynamic DNS service. This service provides you with a URL that never changes and that URL automatically goes to your public IP address, even if it changes. Embedded Control Concepts does support or endorse any dynamic DNS service, but one example is \nDynDNS\n.",

            "text": "Process Editor\n\n\nThe Process Editor page is where most of the configuration on the BCS happens. You can configure up to 8 processes with 8 states on each process. The status of processes, states, and timers are displayed in the Processes section of the \nMain Control\n page.\n\n\nEditing processes and states while they are running may produce erratic or undesirable results.\n\n\nEditing a Process\n\n\nYou can give a process a new name by clicking the \nRename\n button. Simply type in the you desire and hit the \nEnter\n key to save your changes.\n\n\nTo run a process when the BCS starts up, check the \nRun on Startup\n check box. This setting is useful for applications like maintaining the temperature in a refrigerator or kegerator. If the BCS were to reboot because of a power failure, it would automatically start the process to continue maintaining the temperature when power is restored. For an example of this configuration, see the \nConfiguration Examples\n page.\n\n\nThe \nDisplay\n pulldown menu allows to choose when the process is shown on the \nMain Control\n screen. Your choices are When \nRunning\n, \nAlways\n, and \nNever\n.\n\n\nThe \nState\n pulldown menu allows you to choose which state you want to edit. Once you select a state, the state editing section will display on the this page.\n\n\n\n\nEditing a State\n\n\nWhen you select a state to edit, the state editor opens which contains several different sections.\n\n\nState\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you can give the state a name. For instance, if the purpose of the process is to set and hold a mash temperature, you might call this state \"Hold Mash Temp\". To change the state name, click in the \nState Name\n field and type the name you desire. The name will be automatically saved when you hit the \nEnter\n key or the \nTab\n key.\n\n\nYou can set an alarm to sound when the state is exited by choosing one from the \nAlarm when exiting state\n pulldown menu. Your choices are \nNone\n, \nShort\n, and \nLoop\n. If you choose \nNone\n, no alarm will sound. A \nShort\n alarm will only sound for 6 seconds. A \nLoop\n alarm will sound until you turn it off.\n\n\nThe \nSend email on Alarm\n check box enables an email to be sent when the alarm is triggered. The destination email address can be configured on the \nSettings\n page.\n\n\nFrom the \nStart Processes\n row, you can choose which other processes you want to run when the state exit condition occurs. This is useful for chaining processes like starting your boil process when a certain mash state is exited.\n\n\nFrom the \nStop Processes\n row, you can choose which processes you want to stop when the state exit condition occurs.\n\n\nFrom the Assert Registers row, you can utilize any ladder logic registers that you have configured on the \nLadder Logic\n page. When you check the box to assert a register, that register will be turned on  (or asserted) when the state is active.\n\n\nTimers\n\n\nThe Timers section allows you to configure up to four timers to be associated with the state. The status of the timers will be displayed on the \nMain Control\n page if enabled.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nName\n column allows you to configure custom names for your timers. To change the name of the timer, type in the name you desire and hit the \nEnter\n key. The \nUsed\n checkbox column allows you to designate whether or not the timer on that line will be used in the state. The \nCount Up\n column allows you to configure whether the timer will be a \ncount down\n or \ncount up\n timer. The \nContinue\n column allows to configure whether or not the timer will continue counting from the previous state. An example of continuing the timer would be a mash timer that transitions from the mash state to a recirculation state, but you want the timer to keep running. When the continue box is checked, the Initial Value field is not used. The \nInitial Value\n column is used to configure the starting amount of time for the timer. Time is expressed as H:MM:SS. Typically, the starting value for Count Up and/or continuous timers is 0:00:00. Count Down timers are configured for the amount of time you desire. As an example, a one hour mash timer would be configured as a Count Down timer and the value would be 1:00:00.\n\n\nRamp Mode\n\n\nRamp mode allows you to program a rise or drop in temperature over time. This function is useful for dropping fermentation temperatures over time. As an example, a state that contains a ramp mode to cold crash a fermentor could be triggered after another timer based state that controlled the temperature during active fermentation.\n\n\n\n\nTo enable ramp mode, check the \nEnabled\n box. You can associate the ramp mode profile with one or more outputs. To enable an output, check the box next to the output you want to enable. Use the \nOutput Control (Configurable)\n section to associate the chosen output(s) with temp probes, SSRs, pumps, valves, etc. \nIf you are using ramp mode, your ramp mode temperatures will override any temperature settings that you configure for an associated output in the \nOutput Control (Configurable)\n section.\n Enter your starting temperature for ramp mode in the \nStart Temp\n box. Enter your finishing temperature in the \nEnd Temp\n box. Remember, you can use ramp mode to raise or lower temperatures over time. It all depends on your configuration and application. Enter the time over which you want to ramp from your starting temp to your end temp in the \nTime\n box. The time is expressed as HH:MM:SS.\n\n\nOutput Control (Configurable)\n\n\nThis section allows you to control the variables associated with outputs 0-7 for the selected state. \n\n\n\n\nFor each listed output (number of outputs is different for the BCS 460 and the BCS 462) you are presented with several options. The \nMode\n column,the choices are \nDirect\n, \nDuty Cycle\n, \nHysteresis\n, and \nPID\n. \n\n\nDirect Mode\n\n\nIn \nDirect\n mode, the choices are to have the output either \non\n or \noff\n when the state is active. When \nDirect\n mode is chosen, choose either the on or off radio button in the \nSetpoint\n column.\n\n\n\n\nDuty Cycle Mode\n\n\nDuty Cycle\n mode is most useful for electric heating elements since they are more suited to cycling through numerous on/off cycles. This is as opposed to a freezer compressor which can be worn out in short order when cycled on and off multiple times in a short time frame. In Duty Cycle mode, the \nSetpoint\n column is used to set the percentage of time of the duty cycle that the output will be turned on. The duty cycle setpoint is a percentage of the configured \nOutput Period\n that is configured for the selected output under \nPID Settings\n on the \nSettings\n page.\n\n\n\n\nHysteresis Mode\n\n\nHysteresis\n mode is used to maintain temperatures at a setpoint with an allowable amount of temperature swing above and/or below the setpoint. In \nHysteresis\n mode, you can select whether the output will be used to \nHeat\n or \nCool\n from the \nHeat/Cool\n pulldown menu. You can also select which \nTemperature Probe\n is used to measure temperature. Enter the desired \nSetpoint\n temperature. By default, the temperature is measured in Fahrenheit. The temperature setting for the BCS can be changed to Celsius on the \nSettings\n page. The \nSwing\n field is used to set that acceptable amount of temperature swing from the setpoint. In this example, a setpoint of 68 in Cool mode and a swing of 2 would result in the output to turn on at 70 and keep running until the temperature reached 68. Depending on use and outside factors (like ambient air temp), you will need to decide what the acceptable swing is balanced with the cycling of your heating or cooling system.\n\n\n\n\nPID Mode\n\n\nPID\n mode is able to provide a tighter temperature range variance than \nHysteresis\n mode, but is not suitable for all applications. For instance, \nPID\n mode is not always suitable for controlling a freezer or refrigerator since it may cause the compressor to cycle too often. \nPID\n stands for proportional-integral-derivative. The \nPID\n algorithm is able to maintain a tighter temperature range without over-shooting the target temperature. The PID settings can be customized on the \nSettings\n page. In \nPID\n mode, you can select whether the output will be used to \nHeat\n or \nCool\n from the \nHeat/Cool\n pulldown menu. You can also select which \nTemperature Probe\n is used to measure temperature. Enter the desired \nSetpoint\n temperature. By default, the temperature is measured in Fahrenheit. The temperature setting for the BCS can be changed to Celsius on the \nSettings\n page. \n\n\n\n\nOutput Control (Direct On/Off)\n\n\nThis section allows you to directly turn outputs on or off when the state is active. This is useful for turning pumps on or off during mash recirculation or opening or closing glycol valves during fermenation. \nThis functionality is only available on the BCS 462\n. To control an output, select the \nEnabled\n check box for the desired output. When an output is Enabled, you can then select whether the output will be on or off using the \nOn/Off\n pulldown menu.\n\n\n\n\nExit Conditions\n\n\nThis section allows you to configure conditions that will cause the state to end. You can configure up to four exit conditions. The state will exit when any of the enabled conditions are met. To enable an exit condition, select the check box next to the exit condition row in the \nEnabled\n column. In the \nSource Type\n column, you can choose \nTemp Probe\n, \nTimer\n, or \nDigital Input\n. \n\n\nIf the \nSource Type\n is \nTemp Probe\n, you can choose which temp probe to use under the \nSource\n column. Under the \nCondition\n column you can choose greater than or equal to (>=) or less than or equal to (<=). Under the \nValue\n column you can enter the desired temperature for the exit condition. By default, the temperature is measured in Fahrenheit. The temperature setting for the BCS can be changed to Celsius on the \nSettings\n page. In the \nNext State\n column you can choose what happens after the state exits. The choices are another state (\nState #\n), \nWait for Input\n, or \nStop Process\n. If you choose to exit to another state, that state will begin (the next step in brewing process, crash cool, etc.). If you choose \nWait for Input\n, the process will continue, but you will be alerted that manual intervention is necessary. If you select \nStop Process\n, the current process will end.\n\n\nIf the \nSource Type\n is \nTimer\n, you can choose which timer to use under the Source column. Under the \nCondition\n column you can choose greater than or equal to (>=) or less than or equal to (<=). Under the \nValue\n column you can select the timer value (this will vary depending on if you selected a count down or count up timer). The time is expressed as H:MM:SS. In the \nNext State\n column you can choose what happens after the state exits. The choices are another state (\nState #\n), \nWait for Input\n, or \nStop Process\n.

If you choose \nWait for Input\n, the process will continue, but you will be alerted that manual intervention is necessary. If you select \nStop Process\n, the current process will end.\n\n\nIf the \nSource Type\n is \nDigital Input\n, you can choose which DIN to use (as an example, this could be a push button or a toggle switch). In the \nValue\n column you can choose either \non\n or \noff\n for the DIN. In the \nNext State\n column you can choose what happens after the state exits. The choices are another state (\nState #\n), \nWait for Input\n, or \nStop Process\n.

            "text": "Ladder Logic\n\n\nWhile programming processes can provide a robust method for programming complex interactions on the BCS, sometimes it is more efficient to use low level programming. That is what ladder logic provides. You do not have to use ladder logic, but if you do it supersedes any processes that have been configured. In addition, unlike processes, ladder logic is always running when the BCS is powered on.\n\n\nLadder Logic Defined\n\n\nLadder logic is based on Boolean functions such as AND and OR. Each rung has five slots. The first four slots are contacts and the last column is a coil. The coil slot is the result of the logic configured in the first four slots. Each slot must be filled with either a Process, Input, Output, Register, or Contact. The slots are connected to each other using Wires. Rungs are in groups of four. Rungs in the same group can be connected using wires. Rungs in different groups cannot be connected directly, but can be connected using Registers (explained below). When changes are made to the ladder logic, they are automatically saved and applied immediately.\n\n\nWires\n\n\nWires are used to connect slots. In order for ladder logic to work, all the slots in a rung must be filled and all the slots must be connected using a wire. When a single rung is connected all the away across from left to right, the relationship between the slots is a logical AND. Slots can also connect via wires to slots above or below as long as they are in the same four rung group. When slots are connected vertically, the relationship between the slots is a logical OR. \n\n\nThere are several different wire types to choose from to connect slots both horizontally and vertically. To add a wire between slots, simply drag and drop the desired wire from the right side menu to desired location on the ladder. To clear a previously applied wire connection, drag and drop the blank wire icon to the desired spot.\n\n\n\n\nContacts\n\n\nContacts are used to fill slots when you do not need a register, DIN, output, or process to fill that slot. Remember, every slot in the rung must be filled with one of these variables, so contacts are very useful. To add a contact to a slot, simply drag the contact to the desired slot. To clear the contact, drag the blank contact icon to the slot.\n\n\n\n\nRegisters\n\n\nRegister are internal virtual switches on the BCS. Registers can be normally open (NO) or normally closed (NC). Since registers are virtual switches, their status can be used to control other register, outputs, and processes. Registers can also be used to extend ladder logic between rungs, even if they are in another rung group. There are sixteen available registers, numbered 0-15. For more information on how registers can be used, see the examples later in this section.\n\n\n\n\nInputs\n\n\nInputs are the external discrete inputs (DINs) connected to the BCS. In ladder logic, each DIN can be either normally open (NO) or normally closed (NC). The dispostion of a DIN can control the status of registers, outputs, or processes. An input cannot be placed in the coil position. A common use of an input would be to use an external button or switch that in turn controls an output that will turn a pump on or off through ladder logic. For more information on how inputs can be used, see the examples later in this section.\n\n\n\n\nOutputs\n\n\nAn output can be placed in a contact position (columns 1-4) or a coil position (column 5). Each output is available as normally open (NO) and normally closed (NC). While outputs are normally thought of as coils, they can also be used as contacts. See the examples below for more information. If the output is placed in the coil position and all the conditions are met in the contacts, then the output will either be turned on (NO) or off (NC).\n\n\n\n\nProcesses\n\n\nLike outputs, processes can also be placed in either contact or coil slots on the ladder. This behavior is useful is you want to use one process to start or stop another process. Processes can also be started or stopped using and input. Each process is available as running (NO) or stopped (NC).  For more information on how processes can be used, see the examples later in this section.\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nBelow are some common configuration examples using ladder logic. Use the examples below to help build out your ladder logic based on how you use your BCS. Remember, ladder logic takes precedence over any processes that are running. If you have a process running that has an output turned off, but that same output is turned on in ladder logic, then the output will be turned on.\n\n\nExample 1 - Controlling Two Outputs with One Input\n\n\nIn this example input 0 (DIN 0) is used to control two different outputs - OUT 1 and OUT 2. In the normally open position on Rung 0, OUT 1 will be turned on. On Rung 1, when DIN 0 is in the normally closed position, OUT 2 will be turned on. In this example, the first column is populated with the appropriate input. The spaces between the columns are filled with wires, and the desired output is placed in the last, or coil, position.\n\n\n\n\nExample 2 - Logical AND\n\n\nTo create a logical AND function between two or more variables, place them in series. In the example below, if both DIN 1 and DIN 2 are NO, the OUT 3 will be NO (or turned on).\n\n\n\n\nExample 3 - Logical OR\n\n\nTo create a logical OR between variables, place them in parallel. In the example below, if either output 5, 6, or 7 is on, then output 9 will also be on. In this particular example, outputs 5, 6, and 7 are all motorized ball valves that control the flow of coolant in a jacketed conical. Output 9 is a pump the circulates the coolant. The result of this ladder logic is that if any of the ball valves are open, then the pump will turn on. The valves are controlled by a process that is configured to control the fermentation temperatures of the jacketed conicals.\n\n\n\n\nExample 4 - Alarm To Register 10\n\n\nAnother option is to use Register 10 to sound an alarm. This can be configured on the \nSettings\n page under General Settings by checking the \nAlarm to Register 10\n box. This will activate Register 10 any time an alarm is set to sound as a result of processes. In this example, NO Register 10 is in the first slot and is connected via wires and contacts to NO Output 8 in the coil position. When Register 10 is turned on, Output 8 is turned on.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 5 - Starting a Process With an Input\n\n\nIn this example, you can connect a two-way switch to a DIN to start or stop a process.",

To change the name of your BCS, simply type in the name you desire then hit the TAB key. The name is saved automatically.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Settings\n\n\nTo use Celsius instead of the default of Fahrenheit, check the Celsius box. \n\n\nTo set the alarm to Register 10, check the box. For more information on this setting, see Example 4 on the \nLadder Logic\n page.\n\n\nTo configure an email address to send messages to, enter an email address.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nYou can configure an administrator password to prevent unauthorized access to your BCS. This is especially useful if you have setup your BCS to be accessible from the Internet. In addition, you can also configure a read-only password that allows users to view your BCS, but not change any of your settings.\n\n\nTo require users to authenticate, check the \nRequire Authentication\n box. If you do not set a password, the default password is \ncontrol\n. The default user name is \nadmin\n. To assign your own admin password, enter it in the Password and Confirm Password boxes. You can also assign a Read-Only password in the \nRead-Only Credentials\n section.\n\n\n\n\nTemperature Probes\n\n\nIn this section, you can configure custom names for your temperature probes and customize the coefficients for the temperature probes. The BCS is pre-programmed with the default coefficients for temperature probes from \nBrewers Hardware\n. If you bought temperature probes from a retailer other than \nBrewers Hardware\n, please see the coefficient settings from the manufacturer. To assign a name to a temperature probe, simply type the name in the proper box. If you are not using all the temperature probes, uncheck the Enabled box for that probe to prevent it from showing up on the \nMain Control\n page and other menus.\n\n\n\n\nDiscrete Inputs\n\n\nTo assign names to your Discrete Inputs, enter the desired name in the name box for the DIN. By default, all the DINs are enabled. You can disable DINs by unchecking the Enabled box for individual DINs. This will prevent the DINs from showing up on the \nMain Control\n page and other menus.\n\n\nThe One-Shot check box enables one-shot capability on the DIN. One-shot is useful for using DIN to manually changes states in a process (see the Exit Conditions section on the \nProcess Editor\n page. By checking the One-Shot box, the DIN (assuming you have a switch or button connected to it) you would trigger the exit condition and not have to worry about accidentally holding down the button and cycling rapidly through states.\n\n\n\n\nOutputs\n\n\nYou can assign custom names for your outputs by typing in the desired name in the appropriate box. You can also choose whether or not an output is enabled or disabled by checking or unchecking the Enabled box. Disabled outputs will not appear on the \nMain Control\n page or other menus.\n\n\n\n\nAuto-Ignition\n\n\nThe Auto-Ignition section allows you to customize the behavior of electric igniters and burner valves. For instance, in the graphic below the gas valve is connected to output 0 and is therefore the \nTrigger Output\n. The \nIgniter Warm-up Time\n is the amount of time that the Trigger Output will be delayed while the igniter begins firing. The \nIgnition Time\n is total amount of time that the igniter will fire. The \nIgniter Output\n is the output to which the igniter is connected (in this case, it is output 11).\n\n\n\n\nPID Settings\n\n\nPID is very useful in brewing applications since it is a predictive algorithm that reduce variations in temperature swings. \nPID\n mode is able to provide a tighter temperature range variance than \nHysteresis\n mode, but is not suitable for all applications. For instance, \nPID\n mode is not always suitable for controlling a freezer or refrigerator since it may cause the compressor to cycle too often. \nPID\n stands for proportional-integral-derivative. The \nPID\n algorithm is able to maintain a tighter temperature range without over-shooting the target temperature.\n\n\nDepending on your system, you may need to adjust some settings to optimize performance. This usually takes some experimentation since all systems are different. The \nPID Settings\n that are configured here relate directly to the \nOutput Control (Configurable)\n section on the \nProcess Editor\n page. If you choose PID as your mode on this page, the temperature probe you select will be used in the PID calculations for that output.\n\n\nThe most common adjustments will be made to the \nSample Period\n, \nOutput Period\n, and \nMax Pulse %\n boxes. The \nSample Period\n is how often the PID process samples the temperature from the associated input expressed in seconds. The \nOutput Period\n (expressed in seconds) relates directly to the \nMax Pulse %\n. The BCS uses pulse width modulation (PWM) to control electric devices. As a result, if the \nOutput Period\n is 10 seconds and the \nMax Pulse %\n is 80, then the output will be on for 8 seconds during that 10 second period.\n\n\nIf you are using \nDuty Cycle\n as your mode on the \nProcess Editor\n page, the number you entered in the \nSetpoint\n column is the percentage of time that the output will be on. The \nOutput Period\n is used to determine how many seconds the cycle will be. For instance, if you configured the duty cycle \nSetpoint\n to 70 and the \nOutput Period\n to 10, for every 10 seconds the output will be on for 7 seconds and off for 3 seconds. \n\n\nExpansion Devices\n\n\nLED display devices can be added to the BCS by connecting them to the \nEXP0\n and \nEXP1\n connections. LED displays are useful when you are building control box and/or you want to display temperatures without having to use a computer. LED displays are available from retailers like \nBrewers Hardware\n. To associate a temperature probe with an LED display, enter the correct address for LED (most ship with the default address of 0x2a, follow the manufacturers directions for the customizing the address) then choose the associated temperature probe.\n\n\n\n\nNetworking\n\n\nIn order to access the BCS over a network, the BCS must have a valid IP address. The easiest way to accomplish this is to use DHCP to automatically assign an IP address. DHCP is enabled by default, so if you have a router or DHCP server on your network, the BCS will be assigned an IP address. To find the IP address that was assigned to your BCS, you can either look on your router or DHCP server to see which IP address was assigned to the BCS \nMAC Address\n. You can also use the \nBCS Finder\n.\n\n\nTo manually assign an IP address to your BCS, uncheck the \nDHCP Enabled\n box, enter you IP address information in the \nAdvanced\n section, and click on the \nUpdate Network Settings\n button.\n\n\n\n\nFirmware Upgrade\n\n\nTo upgrade your BCS to the latest firmware, you must use TFTP which is a simple program used to transfer files on the local network. There are several free TFTP servers available on the Internet. Download the firmware file to your computer and follow the instructions for setting up your chose TFTP server. Enter the IP address of your TFTP server in the IP Address box and click the \nUpgrade\n button. Once the download is complete, the BCS will take a few minutes to install the upgrade and reboot. Be sure to back-up your configuration before you upgrade.\n\n\n\n\nSystem Reset\n\n\nIf you need to reboot the BCS, click on the \nSystem Reset\n button. To reset the BCS to the default settings (all configurations will be lost), click on the \nReset to Defaults\n button.",
