# Main Control #

The Main Control is the primary page used for controlling processes, observing temperatures, as well as controlling inputs and outputs.



## Current Temperatures

The Current Temperatures are displayed here for all active temperature probes. Temperatures can be displayed in three different styles - LED, Dial, or Compact. The display style is chosen using the pull-down menu in the upper right corner of the screen.
