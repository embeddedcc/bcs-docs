# BCS Documentation

Welcome to the user guide for the BCS series brewery controllers.  

## Setup

The BCS should be connected via ethernet cable to your network.  It is configured by default to obtain an IP address via DHCP from your router.  The [BCS Finder](finder.md) will help locate the BCS on your network.

It is highly recommended to create a DHCP Reservation on your router so the BCS will always have the same IP address.  This setup is specific to each individual router, please check the manual for your router to learn how to set up a DHCP reservation.
